# Advanced

After completing the fundamentals, you may be dissatisfied with the generated images. For example, you might find: 
* The resolution of the generated images is insufficient.
* Part of the content of the generated images is not satisfactory, and you want to modify it.
* You might want enhanced control over the generation process, such as controlling the poses of characters in the images, etc.

The Advanced level will introduce more methods to help you overcome these issues. <strong>Upon completing the Advanced level, it means you'll be able to control model outputs relatively accurately.</strong>
