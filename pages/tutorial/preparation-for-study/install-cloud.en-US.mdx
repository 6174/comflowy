# ComfyUI Cloud Installation

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If you're not very familiar with coding, I strongly recommend that you install and use ComfyUI locally. Additionally, if you're interested in the cloud version but don't know much about coding, you might want to try Comflowy's [cloud version](https://app.comflowy.com). All it takes is registration to get started.
</Callout>

## Step one, register for cloud services

You can install ComfyUI on various cloud platforms, such as Kaggle, Google Colab (currently, running Stable Diffusion models may not be allowed), Paperspace, etc.

We recommend using [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) because their free version offers up to 30 hours of free GPU usage per week, which is a great value. If you haven't registered for Kaggle, you can click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?phase=startRegisterTab&returnUrl=%2F) to sign up.

  </PhotoView>
</PhotoProvider>

## Step two, notebook duplication

After registration, you can visit the ComfyUI's Kaggle page by clicking [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pogscafe/comfyui-kaggle). Click the `Copy and Edit` button in the upper right corner to clone the ComfyUI Notebook to your Kaggle account.

## Step three, execute notebook

<Steps>
  ### Setting notebook options
  After navigating to your Notebook page, click to expand the Notebook Options panel on the right:
  <br/>
  <PhotoProvider>
    <PhotoView src="/install-comfyui-and-model/020.png">
        <img src="/install-comfyui-and-model/020.png" alt="" width="100%" style={{ display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }}/>
    </PhotoView>
  </PhotoProvider>
  Then do the following:
  1. Change the Accelerator to a faster GPUT4X2 or P100.
  2. Set Persistence to Files only.
  3. Set Environment to Pin to original (this ensures that subsequent code runs won't fail due to environmental changes. If you are familiar with Python, you can set it to Always use latest environment).
  4. Enable Internet.
  <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    Note: The Internet option must be set to open. If it is not open, the subsequent code will not run. If you don't see the Internet option, your Kaggle account may need to verify your phone number in order to use this function.
  </Callout>
  ### Execute the Installation code
  Click the code under the Installation title, then you'll see a `Run` button on the left. Click on it to initiate executing code, at this point, you'll notice `Run` turns into to a `Stop` button. Wait for awhile; once it displays the following code, that means the installation is complete:
  ```shell
  Successfully installed matrix-client-0.4.0
  ```
  Or when you see the `Stop` button change back to a `Run` button, that also means that the code has finished execution.
  ### Execute the Install a Model code
  Next, skip over the Start the WebUI section and first execute the install a model code. This way, after running the Start code, you can immediately generate graphs, saving some time. Click the code under the Install a model title. Again, you'll see a `Run` button on the left. Click on it to start executing code. Wait for awhile; once it displays the following code, that means the model installation is complete:
  ```shell
  ‘JuggernautXL.safetensors’ saved
  ```
  ### Execute the Start the WebUI Code
  Lastly, execute the Start the WebUI code. During the execution, you should see a link ending with "moe", similar to:
  ```shell
  http://ssshdiosaoshagohdaoghdoa.remote.moe/
  ```
  Click the link to access the ComfyUI WebUI page.
  <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    Note: After executing the Start the WebUI code, it will continuously consume GPU time.

## Q&A

<FAQBox title="Getting an OpenSSL error when starting the webui">
  > Error code as follows: OpenSSL version mismatch. Built against 30000020, you have 30100040
  rm: Cannot remove '/root/.ssh/id_rsa': No such file or directory
  OpenSSL version mismatch. Built against 30000020, you have 30100040
  OpenSSL version mismatch. Built against 30000020, you have 30100040. This issue is from Discord user **designwill**.

  **Answer from Jimmy:**
  This situation occurs when you pause the service and then try to restart it by just rerunning the start the webui code. You need to run the Installation code again before rerunning the start the webui code to avoid this error.
