# How to use IPAdapter Plus for content transformation and integration in ComfyUI?

Last issue, we introduced the function of IPAdapter in style transfer. In this issue, we will continue the topic. In addition to style transfer, the IPAdapter node can also perform image content transformation and integration.

## Display of Effects

The IPAdapter model can easily apply the style or theme of a reference image to the generated image, providing an effect similar to single-image LoRA. You can control the influence of the two images by adjusting the values of the weights. I tried this workflow with the following avatar and poster. As you can see, by blending image features, you only need to choose two images you like; there is no need to start drawing or designing from scratch to create personalized original images.

### 1. Ghibli-Style Avatar

In the modern digital world, the presentation of personal images is becoming increasingly diverse, and original avatars have become an important element of personal expression and social interaction. An attractive original avatar can increase a user's social advantage. Ghibli animations are known for their warm, imaginative stories and profound themes. Using an avatar in this style can enhance the emotional depth of social interactions. Therefore, I attempted to create an original Ghibli-style avatar using IPAdapter.

The method is quite simple: you just need to choose any Ghibli-style reference image and combine it with your own photo. This way, the generated avatar retains personal image features while protecting personal privacy, and it provides a safe online identity marker.

When selecting the reference image, I deliberately chose one that matched the pose, angle, and props of the real photo. You can control the final effect by adjusting the weights. I aimed for a balanced final result that preserves the character's features while transforming the style intensity, so I set the weight to 2.5 for the image below.

If you want the facial features of the generated avatar to resemble you more closely, you can change the model under the IPAdapter Unified Loader node to a face model. For the differences between the standard IPAdapter model and the face model, please refer to the section on downloading models in [**How to perform style transfer using IPAdapter Plus in ComfyUI?**](https://www.comflowy.com/blog/IPAdapter-Plus)

### 2. Living Like Modern People Series

### 3. Mondrian Mashup Poster

What sparks will fly when Mondrian's geometric abstraction meets traditional Chinese freehand landscape painting? I used Mondrian's classic work "Composition with Red, Yellow, and Blue" as a reference image to see what effect it would have when fused with the style of landscape freehand painting.

Using Mondrian's 《Composition with Red, Yellow, and Blue》" as a style reference, the vivid contrasting colors and bold lines are integrated into the landscape. The volumes are expressed through simple color blocks, and the blending of colors aligns with the concept of 'clear in the near and vague in the distance.' The sense of space and volume is harmoniously represented through the solidity and void of colors and lines.

### 4. Cyberpunk Style

The cyberpunk style often uses bright neon colors contrasted with dark backgrounds to create a futuristic urban nightscape atmosphere. This style frequently showcases the clash between high technology and everyday life. Images might feature advanced technological products coexisting with dilapidated urban environments, such as dense skyscrapers, intricate networks of roads and bridges, and futuristic urban infrastructure.

Using the ComfyUI IPAdapter Plus workflow, whether it's street scenes or character creation, we can easily integrate these elements into images, creating visually striking works with a strong cyberpunk feel. With the help of IPAdapter, this process becomes more efficient and diverse, allowing creators to explore and experiment with different design concepts and generate impressive cyberpunk-style images.

From the final results, you can see that whether it's street scenes, characters, or even cold plaster, this workflow can give them a cyberpunk feel. If you're interested, you might want to try creating something using this approach.
