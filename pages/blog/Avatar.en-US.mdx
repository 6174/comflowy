### 2. Instant ID IP Adapter

This workflow enables style transfer by inputting a portrait image and a reference image with a specific style. For example, in the image below, I input a reference image in a line-drawing style. This workflow will first accurately recognize the facial features of the input portrait image and then generate a new image with an identical face to the input image. At the same time, the style of the generated image will match the style of the reference line-drawing image.

Whether it's a cartoon style, oil painting style, or line-drawing style, this workflow can easily achieve it, meeting your diverse creative needs and making your work more vivid and creative.

### 3. Instant ID Posed 

By inputting a person's image and a reference image with a specific pose, this workflow can generate a new image with an identical face to the input image, while the pose of the generated image will match that of the reference image. For example, in the image below, I used a front-facing photo of a woman as the reference pose. Regardless of the pose in the input portrait image, the final generated image will maintain the front-facing pose of the woman in the reference photo.

This means that regardless of whether the person in your input image is in a side view, overhead view, or any other pose, the generated image will adjust to the pose of the reference image while retaining the original person's facial features. This feature is especially suitable for image processing needs that require a uniform pose, such as comic creation, character design, and more, making your creative process more flexible and efficient.
