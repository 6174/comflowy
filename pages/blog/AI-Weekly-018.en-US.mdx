# AI Weekly 018

## üÜï What's New?
**Product Update:**

This week, our team is still busy with the development of the cloud version, so this update mainly focuses on optimization and fixes:
- Adapted the VHS extension, you can now use this extension in Comflowy.
- Adapted the --listen mode for ComfyUI.
- Fixed the following bugs:
  - Fixed the issue where pip installation would force a pop-up.
  - Fixed the issue where the Gallery and Home pages did not display webp files saved by the save_animatedwebp node, causing the app to white screen.
  - Fixed the issue where the load_image node would still report a missing image even when an image was present.
  - Fixed the issue where the load_image node would still show an error after selecting an image.
  - Fixed the issue where after moving model files to the model folder and refreshing, the nodes still did not display the model files.
