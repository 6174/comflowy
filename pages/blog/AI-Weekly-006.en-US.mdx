Boximator is a product that controls the motion trajectory of subjects in videos. The method released by Byte is to first circle the subject in the picture, then circle the destination, to generate a video of the subject moving from the starting point to the endpoint. It supports setting the movement path and allows for the selection of multiple subjects. Compatible with SD video models, it can be used as a plugin. There is no experience website available yet; currently, one can send an email to the project side to generate videos.
