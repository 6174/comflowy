Boximator is a product that controls the motion trajectory of subjects in videos.

It supports setting the movement path and allows for the selection of multiple subjects. Compatible with SD video models, it can be used as a plugin. There is no experience website available yet; currently, one can send an email to the project side to generate videos.
