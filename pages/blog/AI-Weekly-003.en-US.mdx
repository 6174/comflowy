* [**Bittensor** ](https://bittensor.com/)

Bittensor is a trading marketplace built for algorithmic models, where the traded assets are the algorithmic models themselves, representing machine intelligence. Due to its combination of AI and Web3 concepts, it has achieved a ranking of 60th in the cryptocurrency market cap. Training artificial intelligence models currently requires significant amounts of data and computing power, making it a costly endeavor. As a result, once large companies and research institutions make breakthroughs, they often establish closed ecosystems, hindering the collaborative development of artificial intelligence.

Therefore, there is a need for decentralized, open-source solutions. Among the three core elements of AI: data, algorithms, and computing power, Bittensor focuses on the algorithmic aspect. It does this by utilizing blockchain networks and incentive mechanisms to schedule and select different algorithms, creating a marketplace where AI can thrive through free competition and knowledge sharing.

* [**Botto** ](https://www.botto.com/)

Botto is a generative AI artist born in October 2021, belonging to the Botto DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). It was collectively trained by community members and is the world's first decentralized autonomous AI artist. Its NFT artworks have been auctioned on the crypto art platform SuperRare, generating sales revenue in the tens of millions of Chinese yuan.While it has become easy to prompt AI to generate art using keyword prompts, determining what art is valuable remains a complex question. AI itself cannot make such value judgments. Therefore, Botto creatively introduced a DAO mechanism where DAO members vote to decide what artworks are valuable ("crowdsourcing wisdom"). This data can then be used to train the AI artist to continuously generate new, high-quality works of art.
