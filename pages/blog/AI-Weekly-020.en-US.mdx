[**Manga Cosplay**](https://openart.ai/workflows/datou/manga-cosplay/SgsFFSuOeFe7Qzs3eHij)

This is a workflow that can use real photos to generate cartoon-style illustrations, primarily utilizing InstantID and BRIA RMBG to remove the background. However, it is only suitable for single-person scenarios, as it replaces only one face. If you want to use it for multi-person scenarios, you can disable the faceswap module.

### üìÑ Noteworthy papers and technic

[**AniTalker**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03121v1)

AniTalker can transform a single static portrait and input audio into an animated conversation video with natural, fluid motions. It's like bringing the person in the photo to life, making them move in sync with the audio. The lip movements match the speech, and the facial expressions and head movements appear very natural, just like a real person talking.

[**Vidu**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04233)

Vidu is a high-performance text-to-video generator capable of creating up to 16 seconds of 1080p video in a single generation. It is a diffusion model based on U-ViT, capable of producing realistic and imaginative videos. It also understands some professional photography techniques, as demonstrated in the image below, where it can control the direction and movement of light sources within the scene.

[**MistoLine**](https://github.com/TheMistoAI/MistoLine)

MistoLine can generate high-quality images directly from hand-drawn sketches that match the contours of the sketches. It is an SDXL-ControINet-based model that can be used in ComfyUI. By utilizing various line drawings provided by the user (including hand-drawn sketches, line drawings generated by different preprocessors, and outlines automatically generated by the model), it achieves flexible adaptation to different types of sketches and high-precision image generation.

[**xLSTM**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04517)

xLSTM is an upgrade to the original LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network. LSTM is a highly effective tool for handling sequential data, such as language and time series prediction. However, when dealing with very large datasets, LSTM can struggle. xLSTM addresses these issues by introducing exponential gating and modifying the LSTM memory structure.

[**Lumina-T2X**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05945v1)

Lumina-T2X can convert text descriptions into high-definition images, videos, 3D models, and audio. Using specialized techniques to process text, it can generate high-resolution and arbitrarily sized multimodal content. In simple terms, if you can describe it, Lumina-T2X can create the corresponding visual or audio content based on your description. Compared to OpenAI's DALL-E, Lumina-T2X can handle multimodal content generation, including text-to-image tasks, while excelling in high-resolution image capabilities. Its model architecture and scale also surpass some versions of DALL-E or GPT-3.
