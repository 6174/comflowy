* [**Bittensor** ](https://bittensor.com/)

Bittensor is a trading marketplace built for algorithmic models, where the traded assets are the algorithmic models themselves, representing machine intelligence. Due to its combination of AI and Web3 concepts, it has achieved a ranking of 60th in the cryptocurrency market cap. Training artificial intelligence models currently requires significant amounts of data and computing power, making it a costly endeavor. As a result, once large companies and research institutions make breakthroughs, they often establish closed ecosystems, hindering the collaborative development of artificial intelligence.

Therefore, there is a need for decentralized, open-source solutions. Among the three core elements of AI: data, algorithms, and computing power, Bittensor focuses on the algorithmic aspect. It does this by utilizing blockchain networks and incentive mechanisms to schedule and select different algorithms, creating a marketplace where AI can thrive through free competition and knowledge sharing.
