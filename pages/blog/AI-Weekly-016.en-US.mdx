### üìÑ Noteworthy papers and technic

[**ScreenAl**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04615)

ScreenAI is a visual language model developed by the Google Research team, specifically designed for understanding and processing user interfaces and infographics. It identifies the type and location of UI elements through screen annotation tasks, using these annotations to describe screen content. 

What sets ScreenAI apart is its ability to handle screen images of various resolutions and aspect ratios. It automatically creates training data through self-supervised learning and model-generated annotations. Compared to the previously recommended Ferret-UI, ScreenAI is primarily used to enhance our understanding of UI and infographics displayed on screens.

[**SceneScript**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13064)

SceneScript is a 3D scene reconstruction technology that uses an autoregressive structured language model to generate and express physical space layouts. Its most notable feature is the ability to directly infer the geometric shape of a room from a video stream and convert this information into text, such as "door: size-y = 1.9."

This technology allows for convenient architectural modeling via video capture, eliminating the need for manual data entry through measurements.

[**Infini-attention**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07143)

Infini-attention is an innovative attention mechanism that enhances the capability of Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) to process extremely long input sequences by integrating compressed memory. This approach efficiently controls the use of memory and computational resources. The technique merges local masked attention with long-term linear attention within a single Transformer module. This not only improves the model's performance in tasks such as long text language modeling, long text retrieval, and book summarization but also significantly reduces memory usage. Infini-attention provides an efficient and practical solution for understanding and processing lengthy texts.

[**Making an Invisibility Cloak**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14667)

The paper discusses how carefully designed adversarial attacks can be employed to render objects "invisible" in the real world to target detectors. The team developed a special pattern that can be physically applied over objects to mislead machines, making them unable to correctly recognize or locate the objects. The core objective of the research is to reveal vulnerabilities in detection systems and to propose solutions for transferring adversarial attacks from the digital realm to the physical world. This exploration not only underscores the security gaps in current detection technologies but also advances the discussion on the practical implications of adversarial machine learning.
