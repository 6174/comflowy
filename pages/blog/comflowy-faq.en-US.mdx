## Potential Issues During Installation

During the installation process, you may encounter some issues. Here are solutions for some common problems.

If you come across any issues not mentioned in this article, you can provide feedback on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/xqB9VyEX), and we will be happy to assist you ðŸ˜Ž

During the installation, our product will display the progress. You can identify which step the installation has reached by the title of the progress and look up the corresponding solutions.

### Git Installation Failure

If you encounter an error message similar to the one below while installing Git, you could try to manually install [Git](https://git-scm.com/), and then restart Comflowy afterward.

### Conda Installation Failure

If you encounter a long wait time during the Install Conda step, this is normal because the Conda package is quite large and takes some time to download. If you have waited a long time and there is still no response, you could try to manually install [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/). After installation, restart Comflowy.

You can install it in one of the following two ways:
