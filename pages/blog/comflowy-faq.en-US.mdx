## Potential Issues During Installation

During the installation process, you may encounter some issues. Here are solutions for some common problems.

If you come across any issues not mentioned in this article, you can provide feedback on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/xqB9VyEX), and we will be happy to assist you ðŸ˜Ž

During the installation, our product will display the progress. You can identify which step the installation has reached by the title of the progress and look up the corresponding solutions.

### Git Installation Failure

If you encounter an error message similar to the one below while installing Git, you could try to manually install [Git](https://git-scm.com/), and then restart Comflowy afterward.

### Conda Installation Failure

If you encounter a long wait time during the Install Conda step, this is normal because the Conda package is quite large and takes some time to download. If you have waited a long time and there is still no response, you could try to manually install [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/). After installation, restart Comflowy.

You can install it in one of the following two ways:
1. Download the Installer and install it.
2. Use command line for installation:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
curl https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh -o ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
rm -rf ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
```

Usage
Working with Multiple Different Base Models
When you run a certain workflow, you might encounter an issue where after clicking run, the workflow executes for a while and then stops. If you open the Console at this point, you might see the following error:

```bash
RuntimeError: linear(): input and weight.T shapes cannot be multiplied (154x2048 and 768x320)
```

This most likely means you are using model files from different base models in your workflow; you need to switch all the model files to those from the same base model.
Taking this workflow as an example, you can look closely at the two nodes I have grouped together in the upper left corner:
* For the ControlNet Loader, I'm using the sd1.5 canny model file.
* For the Checkpoint Loader, I'm using the photonium model file, which is fine-tuned with sdxl.

This is a case of using model files from multiple different base models. In such instances, you just need to standardize the models to be consistent. For instance, in this case, you can adjust the ControlNet Loader's model file to the sdxl canny model file.
