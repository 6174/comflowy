* [**NaturalSpeech 3**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03100)

NaturalSpeech 3 utilizes an innovative decomposed diffusion model to break down speech into independent subspaces such as content, prosody, timbre, and acoustic details, generating these attributes separately to effectively simulate complex speech. It surpasses existing technologies in terms of speech quality, similarity, prosody, and intelligibility. Particularly on the LibriSpeech test set, its synthetic speech quality is comparable to real speech.
