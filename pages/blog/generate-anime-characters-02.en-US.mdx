# How to use ComfyUI to turn anime characters into real people ②

In our last session, we shared this workflow and introduced "How to use ComfyUI to turn anime characters into real people?" In this issue, we continue to use this workflow for some interesting exploration to see if it can bring us some other surprises.

## Canny Workflow 

Last time, we shared a few pictures that transformed characters from One Piece into comic style. This time let's try with Naruto characters and see how effective it is together.

In addition to converting anime characters into real people, this workflow allows you to switch checkpoint models or add LoRA nodes, enabling you to generate even more unique images.

For example, you can create images of anime characters with a 3D texture. After trying out several models for generating 3D images and comparing them, I believe that the [3D Animation Diffusion](https://civitai.com/models/118086/3d-animation-diffusion) model produces the best results.

Here are two 3D images I tried generating; you can see for yourself how effective they are:

## Canny + LoRA Workflow 

Additionally, you can try using Canny and LoRA together, enabling you to generate images with even more styles. Moreover, you could reverse the approach and try converting real people into anime characters to see how it works. For instance, you can use the LineArt effect LoRA to transform real people into pencil-drawn anime characters:

<br/>
<PhotoProvider>
  <PhotoView src="/blog/generate-anime-characters/017.jpeg">
    <img src="/blog/generate-anime-characters/017.jpeg" alt="" className='rounded-lg'/>
  </PhotoView>
</PhotoProvider>

By adjusting parameters and prompts, you can generate images with thematic colors:

<br/>
<PhotoProvider>
  <PhotoView src="/blog/generate-anime-characters/018.png">
    <img src="/blog/generate-anime-characters/018.png" alt="" className='rounded-lg'/>
  </PhotoView>
</PhotoProvider>

Alternatively, you can use the [Niji Default style](https://civitai.com/models/95007/niji-default-style-niji) LoRA to create anime characters with bright color styles from real people:

<br/>
<PhotoProvider>
  <PhotoView src="/blog/generate-anime-characters/019.png">
    <img src="/blog/generate-anime-characters/019.png" alt="" className='rounded-lg'/>
  </PhotoView>
</PhotoProvider>

Finally, I recommend another LoRA called [From Below | Low Angle Shot](https://civitai.com/models/287958/from-below-or-low-angle-shot?modelVersionId=323858), which can generate low-angle shots. The images created with this feature have a harmonious blend of characters and environments, with a strong sense of atmosphere in the scenes.
