After several months of product refinement, we have finally completed the development of the Alpha version. We now invite users with Mac M chip computers for testing. Please give us your feedback if any problems arise.

Additionally, we provide multi-tab functionality that allows you to open and run multiple workflows concurrently, improving multitasking efficiency.
- It supports a template feature unavailable in ComfyUI, providing one-click use for all templates provided in this tutorial.
- We have optimized many ComfyUI experience issues, making it more convenient and easy to use.

Therefore, we've decided to write a series of hands-on tutorials to teach everyone how to apply ComfyUI to real work cases, as well as sharing some tricks to help everyone use ComfyUI better.
