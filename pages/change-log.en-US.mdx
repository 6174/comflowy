After several months of product refinement, we have finally completed the development of the Alpha version. We now invite users with Mac M chip computers for testing. Please give us your feedback if any problems arise.

ComflowySpace is a product that we have developed based on ComfyUI. Its functionality is consistent with ComfyUI, but we have made many improvements:

- It supports workflow management features. Here, you can view all your past workflows. With this feature, you no longer need to manually export and save workflows. Additionally, we provide multi-tab functionality that allows you to open and run multiple workflows concurrently, improving multitasking efficiency.
- It supports a template feature unavailable in ComfyUI, providing one-click use for all templates provided in this tutorial.
- We have optimized many ComfyUI experience issues, making it more convenient and easy to use.

**Enjoy last week's new tutorial:**
- [How to generate App logo using ComfyUI?](https://www.comflowy.com/blog/generate-app-logo): Our tutorials have taught a lot about how to use ComfyUI, but some students have reported not knowing how to get started when they want to apply ComfyUI to their work. Also, there are a lot of little configuration items in ComfyUI, and the tutorials haven't covered them one by one, so it's not clear how to configure them. Therefore, we've decided to write a series of hands-on tutorials to teach everyone how to apply ComfyUI to real work cases, as well as sharing some tricks to help everyone use ComfyUI better.
