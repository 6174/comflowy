### Comflowy Review

The LCM model fine-tuned by the creator of DreamShaper, based on DreamShaper, significantly enhances the speed of image generation while ensuring the quality of the output. You can tell from the sample images below that the quality of the images has not decreased significantly.

However, it is important to note that the Sampler in KSampler should be set to LCM Sampler to avoid some issues. Additionally, the recommended number of Steps is 5 to 15 with the CFG scale set to around 2.
