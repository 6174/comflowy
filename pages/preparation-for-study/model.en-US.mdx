# Download & Import Model

After installing ComfyUI, you need to download the corresponding models and import them into the corresponding folders. Before explaining how to download models, let's first briefly understand the differences between different versions of Stable Diffusion, so you can download a suitable version according to your needs.

Additionally, you can refer to these two blog posts:
1. [How to choose the right model?](https://www.comflowy.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-model)
2. [10 models worth downloading](https://www.comflowy.com/blog/ten-models-worth-downloading)

Finally, to help everyone find the most suitable model more easily, we have also created a model recommendation page where you can find the appropriate model according to your needs: [Model Recommendations](https://www.comflowy.com/zh-CN/model).


## Differences between Stable Diffusion versions

<Callout type="info">
  In the subsequent tutorials, I will introduce more about the models.
</Callout>

### Stable Diffusion v1.5
- This is an early version of Stable Diffusion, and many Lora models and ContrlNet models on the market are built based on it. Therefore, to avoid pitfalls when starting to use ComfyUI, it is recommended to start with the 1.5 version.
- The official model introduction: [Stable Diffusion v1.x press release](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release)
- Download: [v1.5 pruned](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5/resolve/main/v1-5-pruned.safetensors?download=true)
### Stable Diffusion v2.0
- This is a major update for Stable Diffusion. Compared to version 1.5, it has improved both in image generation quality and speed.
- Version 2.0 adopts a new text encoder, OpenCLIP, which can better understand text prompts, thus generating higher quality images. In addition, version 2.0 supports higher image resolution, capable of generating images with default resolutions of 512x512 and 768x768 pixels.

### Stable Diffusion XL
- This is the latest version of Stable Diffusion, and it has further optimization and improvements based on version 2.0.
- The main feature of the XL version is its larger model size, expanding from 0.98B to 6.6B parameters, enabling it to generate higher quality images.
- The XL version also introduces new features like more artistic images, more realistic images, and more readable fonts.
- The official model introduction: [Stable Diffusion xl 1.0 press release](https://stability.ai/news/stable-diffusion-sdxl-1-announcement)

## Download models

There are two download channels that I often use, one is HuggingFace, and the last one is from the CivitAI site.

### HuggingFace

You can understand HuggingFace as the Github for AI. There are many individuals or organizations that share their models there. You can search for the model you want via HuggingFace's search function.

For example, when we search for Stable Diffusion v1.5, you will see this page, and then we click the "Files and versions" button on the page (shown as 1), then you'll see many files. At this point, you need to choose the model file you want to download, then click the download button (shown as 2):
<br/>
<PhotoProvider>
  <PhotoView src="/install-comfyui-and-model/010.png">
      <img src="/install-comfyui-and-model/010.png" alt="" className='rounded-lg'/>
  </PhotoView>
</PhotoProvider>

Generally, you will see two types of model suffixes:
- **safetensors**: This type of model is generally saved in numpy format, which means it only saves tensor data with no code, so loading these files is safer and faster.
- **ckpt**: This file is serialized, meaning that they might contain malicious code, loading these type of models could pose a security risk.

So in the above case, I would recommend you download the safetensors format model.

In addition, when searching for a model, I suggest you make sure that it's an official model. Generally, I would look at the download count of the model, typically, the more downloads a model has, the more likely it's from the official source.

### CivitAI

Unlike HuggingFace, the CivitAI site tends to lean more towards UGC (User-Generated Content), so you'll see many more personally trained models. However, this does not mean that their quality will be poor. On the contrary, you'll find that the quality of some models is very good.

Moreover, CivitAI has many more useful functions than HuggingFace. For instance, you can see various excellent models through different filters:
<br/>
<PhotoProvider>
  <PhotoView src="/install-comfyui-and-model/011.png">
      <img src="/install-comfyui-and-model/011.png" alt="" className='rounded-lg'/>
  </PhotoView>
</PhotoProvider>

Similarly, you can also use the search function in CivitAI to search for the model you want and download it. Take DreamShaper as an example, you just need to click on the download button (shown as 1) to download the model:
<br/>
<PhotoProvider>
  <PhotoView src="/install-comfyui-and-model/012.png">
      <img src="/install-comfyui-and-model/012.png" alt="" className='rounded-lg'/>
  </PhotoView>
</PhotoProvider>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  In the following tutorials, I will be using various models. You can download different models from the above two channels according to your needs. But now, I'd recommend you first download the Stable Diffusion v1.5 and Stable Diffusion XL models on HuggingFace. The former has many complementary models, while the latter tends to provide better output images. Many of the latest models are also optimized based on it.

## Import models

<Tabs items={['Import into ComflowySpace', 'Import into ComfyUI']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
      If you are using ComflowySpace, then you can directly import the model into ComflowySpace. The specific steps are as follows:
      1. Switch to the Models interface, then click on the 'Model Folder' button at the top right corner (indicated by ① in the image),
      2. After opening the folder, click to enter the 'checkpoint' folder inside and place the model you downloaded into it. 
      3. Finally, click the 'Refresh' button (indicated by ② in the image).

      <br/>
      <PhotoProvider>
        <PhotoView src="/install-comfyui-and-model/023.png">
            <img src="/install-comfyui-and-model/023.png" alt="" className='rounded-lg'/>
        </PhotoView>
      </PhotoProvider>
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
      Once the models are downloaded, we need to place the corresponding models in the 'models' directory of ComfyUI.

      <Callout type="info">
      If you have previously installed SD WebUI and have downloaded a number of models, there's no need to manually import the models again. All you need to do is modify the configuration file.
      </Callout>

      <Tabs items={['SD WebUI not installed', 'SD WebUI installed']}>
        <Tabs.Tab>
          After downloading the model, we need to place the corresponding model in the models directory of ComfyUI.
          <Steps>
            ### Open the ComfyUI project folder
            You can use the Github Desktop mentioned in the previous chapter to open the ComfyUI project folder. Click the "Show in Finder" button on Github Desktop, or "Show in Explorer" button if you are using Windows, to open the project's folder. Then you need to navigate to the models directory:
            <PhotoProvider>
              <PhotoView src="/install-comfyui-and-model/013.png">
                  <img src="/install-comfyui-and-model/013.png" alt="" width="80%" style={{ display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }}/>
              </PhotoView>
            </PhotoProvider>

            ### Add models to their respective folders
            Upon entering the Model folder, you'll see many folders, each corresponding to a different model. You need to put the model you downloaded into the corresponding folder. For example, the model we just downloaded is the Stable Diffusion v1.5 model, which belongs to checkpoints, and thus needs to be placed in the checkpoints folder. In the future, we will introduce different types of models and you will need to put them in their respective folders. For example, the LoRA model we will cover later should be placed in the loras folder.

              <PhotoView src="/install-comfyui-and-model/014.png">
                  <img src="/install-comfyui-and-model/014.png" alt="" width="80%" style={{ display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }}/>
              </PhotoView>
            </PhotoProvider>
          </Steps>
        </Tabs.Tab>
        <Tabs.Tab>
          <Steps>
            ### Open the ComfyUI project folder
            Open the ComfyUI project folder and find a file called `extra_model_paths.yaml.example` within the ComfyUI folder.
            
            ### Renaming the file
            Next, rename this file to `extra_model_paths.yaml`.
            
            ### Right-click to open the file with VSCode and modify the configuration
            Once the file is open, find this line of code:
            ``` yaml
            base_path: path/to/stable-diffusion-webui/ 
            ```
            Change the path after the colon to your SD webui path. For example, if you're a Mac user, it might be:
            ```shell
            Users/jimmy/stable-diffusion-webui/
            ```
            If you're a Win user, it might be:
            ```shell
            C:/Users/jimmy/stable-diffusion-webui/
            ```
        </Steps>
      </Tabs.Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Tabs.Tab>
