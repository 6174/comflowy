# Comflowy vs ComfyUI

import { Steps, Callout, Tabs } from 'nextra-theme-docs';

Simply understood, Comflowy is a product developed based on ComfyUI, and its kernel is still ComfyUI. We have also open-sourced the code according to the agreement requirements of ComfyUI.

This means that Comflowy has almost all the functions of ComfyUI. Our team has also optimized various usability issues with ComfyUI, making it more user-friendly and its features even more powerful. Below, we will detail the differences between Comflowy and ComfyUI.

    Installing ComfyUI can be tedious and often encounters various unexpected issues, leading to installation failures.
