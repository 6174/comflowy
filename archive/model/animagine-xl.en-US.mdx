### Comflowy Review

The latest version has optimized the understanding of instructions, rather than enhancing aesthetics. I believe this direction is correct, as the aesthetics of the model were already good, and what it lacked more was the ability to understand instructions.
This is especially true for anime-style content, which can include specific elements like hair, eyes, and so on, all requiring the model to have a better understanding. The newest model has made great improvements in this respect.

The score is 8 out of 10, mainly because it is somewhat lacking in complementary features, such as an Inpainting model.
